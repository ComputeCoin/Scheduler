	    \subsection{Overview}
    	% Questions:
    	%   	1.  How are different specification parameter classes being represented in this diagram?
        %               - Each parameter class is represented using a color residing in the box labeled agents.
    	%   	2.  What do all of these colors mean?
        %               - Every color is attributed to a specification parameter class.
   	    %   	3.  How many time steps is this taking?
        %               - The diagram represents one time step of the entire algorithm.
    	%   	4.  How are these colored squares representative of agents?
        %               - The square box represents a specification parameter class and there are a set of agents that
        %                 exist within that class at any one time step.

   	    % Questions:
    	%   	1.  How do the specification parameter vectors interact with the policy advisor?
        %               - When a consumer enters the system they submit a specification parameter vector, which is given
        %                 to the policy advisor as input. The policy advisor produces a policy parameter vector which
        %                 are then used as the weights of the actor network. The actor network is then used as the mechanism
        %                 that the representing scheduling agent will sample from in order to perform actions within the
        %                 system.
    	%   	2.  What is the policy advisor doing in the context of the diagram?
        %               - The policy advisor network is producing policy parameters for the scheduling agents to use
        %                 for the duration of their time in the system.
    	%   	3.  What is a joint action and how does it connect to the agents?
        %               - There are three levels of action that are looked at, the agent action, the class action, and
        %                 the system action.
        %               - An agent action is produced by the actor network of an scheduling agent, a list of agent
        %                 actions within the same class is a class action, and a list of class actions submited to the
        %                 system is a system action, which is referred to in the diagram as the joint action of all the
        %                 agents.


	    \subsection{Model}
        % Questions:
        % 	    1.  Why use reinforcement learning over traditional methods for scheduling?
        %               - Given the nature of the system the rigidness of other solutions would be a produce a critical
        %                 problem in the efficiency and complexity of the scheduling.
        %               - A reinforcement learning approach makes the system adaptable and flexible to changing conditions
        %                 of the environment, which is very desirable.
        %	    2.  What are the overall benefits that this model hopes to bring to the table?
        %               - This model hopes to be able to give insight into mulit-agent problems, as well as how to correct
        %                 the relatively common sub-optimal solutions of greedy algorithms.
        %               - Additionally the model hopes to show how reinforcement learning can be used usefully in solving
        %                 combinatorial problem solving.

                %              - They give a better idea of how the topology of the neural network is organized,
                %                using visual coding with colors.
                %   	2. What do these numeric labels represent?
                %              - The numeric labels are indicative of the specification paramter vectors.

	\section{Discussion}
	% Question:
	% 	    1.  To sum it all up, what are the major advantages of using PANDA for job
	%           scheduling?
	%		-The major advantages of using PANDA for job scheduling is that it allows to schedule jobs with a changing or 		%		dynamic environment, allows for more user autonomy, and looks at the problem from a meta standpoint as opposed 		%		to an individual basis.  This all allows for a more streamline scheduling experience that allows for a more 		%		cohesive system that relies on less metrics than a typical static scheduler.
	% 	    2.  What are the set backs on this approach to solving the problem?
	%		-The setbacks for this approach include focusing too much on the big picture, or metadata, instead of looking 		%		at individual cases to better substantiate useful data, and the idea of letting users as well as the policy 		%		advisor handle fairness may lead to potential conflicts between consumers.
	% 	    3.  How do you plan on mitigating the known set backs?
	%		-The plan is to collect consistent analysis of data that comes in with each consumer and create a relationship 		%		function between the parameters so we can extrapolate where conflicts occur, hence being able to push policy 		%		advisors to make certain decisions based on expectations of recent data.
	%   	4.  How do you plan on setting this system up with no data?
	%		-A general multitude of simulations will be run in order to get an idea of what possible conflicts may arise 		%		with our approach to this problem, allowing us to fine tune individual issues, which can allow us to handle 		%		problems that arise in the metadata before even receiving said data.

        \paragraph{Hybrid Approach}
        % Question:
        % 	    1.  How does this approach mitigate the set backs that have been previously
        %           mentioned?
        %   	2.  How do you plan an integrating both approaches without interfering with the integrity
        %           of the training?
        % 	    3.  How long will this hybrid approach have to be used until the real system is
        %           ready to take over?

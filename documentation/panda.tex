	    \subsection{Overview}
    	% Questions:
    	%   	1.  How are different specification parameter classes being represented in this diagram?
        %               - Each parameter class is represented using a color residing in the box labeled agents.
    	%   	2.  What do all of these colors mean?
        %               - Every color is attributed to a specification parameter class.
   	    %   	3.  How many time steps is this taking?
        %               - The diagram represents one time step of the entire algorithm.
    	%   	4.  How are these colored squares representative of agents?
        %               - The square box represents a specification parameter class and there are a set of agents that
        %                 exist within that class at any one time step.

   	    % Questions:
    	%   	1.  How do the specification parameter vectors interact with the policy advisor?
        %               - When a consumer enters the system they submit a specification parameter vector, which is given
        %                 to the policy advisor as input. The policy advisor produces a policy parameter vector which
        %                 are then used as the weights of the actor network. The actor network is then used as the mechanism
        %                 that the representing scheduling agent will sample from in order to perform actions within the
        %                 system.
    	%   	2.  What is the policy advisor doing in the context of the diagram?
        %               - The policy advisor network is producing policy parameters for the scheduling agents to use
        %                 for the duration of their time in the system.
    	%   	3.  What is a joint action and how does it connect to the agents?
